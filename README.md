# Connect4
The Connect4 Unity project aims to make the game's AI, Marlin, accessible to devices with low processing power, such as mobile phones, tablets, and smart TVs. To achieve this goal, the project utilizes a high-performance server to host the AI. The project includes both a user interface for accessing the server and a user interface for starting and hosting the server.
